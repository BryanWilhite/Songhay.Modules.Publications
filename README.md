# Songhay.Modules.Publications

**NuGet package 📦:** [`Songhay.Modules.Publications`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Songhay.Modules.Publications/)

## shared Publication types and functions for F# clients 🕸🖼

The original intent of this project is the support of data access on the “client” side. There are two types currently considered:

- `DisplayItemModel` [[source](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Modules/blob/main/Songhay.Modules/Models/DisplayItemModel.fs)]
- `SyndicationFeed` [[source](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Modules/blob/main/Songhay.Modules/Models/SyndicationFeed.fs)]

This project supports the generation of these types from JSON ‘shapes’ based on the [abstractions](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/Songhay.Publications/tree/master/Songhay.Publications/Abstractions) defined in `Songhay.Publications`.
